The function used to perform energy calibration is a linear equation E = a*Ch + b
a = 0.002336
b = -0.178248
a_error = 0.00498057
b_error = 1.87175

The function used for the energy resolution curve is sigma_E = E*sqrt(a^2 + b^2/x + c^2/x^2)
a = 0.0552472
b = 0
c = 0.0209245
a_error = 0.331337
b_error = 0
c_error = 0.311095

Chi-square distance for 1st histogram from 0.35 to 0.6 (MeV) = 2.21487
Chi-square distance for 2nd histogram from 0.8 to 1.2 (MeV) = 1.18522
