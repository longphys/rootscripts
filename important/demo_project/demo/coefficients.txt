The function used to perform energy calibration is a linear equation E = a*Ch + b
a = 0.00234799
b = -0.183486
a_error = 0.00500621
b_error = 1.8824

The function used for the energy resolution curve is sigma_E = E*sqrt(a^2 + b^2/x + c^2/x^2)
a = 0.0551548
b = 0
c = 0.0212982
a_error = 0.33546
b_error = 0
c_error = 0.312187

Chi-square distance for 1st histogram from 0.35 to 0.6 (MeV) = 1.93634
Chi-square distance for 2nd histogram from 0.8 to 1.2 (MeV) = 1.17668
